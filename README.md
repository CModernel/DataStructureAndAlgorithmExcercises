# Data Structure and Algorithm Exercises

Welcome to the Data Structure and Algorithm Exercises repository. This collection was designed to strengthen my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts through practical implementation in C++ and C. The exercises are in Spanish, and were exercises I completed while studying **Software Engineering** degree at the **University**.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

‚Ä¢ **2018s1_OblA1_Parte2/:** Contains assignments and projects from the first semester of 2018, labeled as ‚ÄúOblA1 Part 2.‚Äù Dive into this directory to explore specific exercises and their solutions.

## üß© Topics Covered

Enhance your skills with a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

**‚Ä¢	Data Structures:**
  -	Arrays: Understand static data storage and manipulation.
	-	Linked Lists: Explore dynamic data structures for efficient insertion and deletion.
	-	Stacks and Queues: Implement LIFO and FIFO structures for various applications.
	-	Trees:
        - Binary Trees: Learn hierarchical data representation.
        - Binary Search Trees: Efficiently manage sorted data.
	-	Graphs: Traverse complex networks using nodes and edges.
	-	Hash Tables: Achieve constant-time data retrieval with hashing techniques.
**‚Ä¢	Algorithms:**
	-	Sorting Algorithms:
	      -	Quick Sort: Divide-and-conquer approach for efficient sorting.
	      -	Merge Sort: Stable sorting with guaranteed performance.
  -	Searching Algorithms:
        -	Binary Search: Fast search in sorted datasets.
	-	Graph Algorithms:
	      -	Depth-First Search (DFS): Explore nodes deeply before backtracking.
	      -	Breadth-First Search (BFS): Level-order traversal of nodes.
	-	Dynamic Programming: Solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems.
	-	Recursion: Master functions that call themselves for elegant solutions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with these exercises:

### 1.	Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/CModernel/DataStructureAndAlgorithmExcercises.git
```
